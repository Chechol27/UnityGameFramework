# Quickstart

For this example, we're creating a _**Pong**_ game with the following (classic) rules

- 2 Player local competitive gameplay
- There's a time limit of 5 minutes, after this the match ends and a result is calculated based on player score
  - if player scores are different from each other, the player with higher score wins
  - if player scores are equal the match ends in a Tie
- The first player to achieve 8 points wins the match
- Players can only move in the vertical axis and confined to a min-max height

Here are the chapters that will guide you while making a _**Pong**_ clone using this framework:

1. [Game Mode](./GameMode.md)
2. [Game State](./GameState.md)
3. [Player State](./PlayerState.md)
4. [Players](./Player.md)
5. [Pawns Part 1](./PawnCode.md)
6. [Pawns Part 2](./PawnPrefab.md)
5. [Matches](./Match.md)
